# Used Car Pricing Prediction

## Introduction
In the process of buying a used car, it can be difficult to determine if the advertised price is fair and reasonable. Several factors contribute to the price of a used car, including model, make, mileage, year, and more. The objective of this analysis is to predict the price of a used car based on these and other relevant variables.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Determine the significant variables that impact the pricing of a used car.
2. Evaluate how well these variables describe the price of a used car.

## Methodology
To achieve the objectives of this project, the following steps will be taken:

1. Perform data exploration to understand the variables and relationships in the data.
2. Apply machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a used car.
3. Evaluate the importance of each variable in the prediction of the used car price.

## Conclusion
By completing this analysis, we will be able to predict the price of a used car with increased accuracy, based on the significant variables that impact the pricing. This will be a valuable tool for individuals in the process of buying or selling a used car.
